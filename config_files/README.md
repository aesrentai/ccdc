# Config Files
This directory contains sample configuration files for differnent services. These configuration files should be sensible (that is, secure). As we cannot predict what services we will be given during the competition, these files are not intended to be dropped-in unmodified. Rather, they should provide a good starting base for further tweaking/configuration.
